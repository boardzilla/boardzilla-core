/**
 * Stop the flow and wait for a player to act.
 *
 * @param options.actions - An array of possible actions. Each action can be
 * either a string or on object. If a string, it is the name of the action as
 * defined in {@link Game#defineActions}. If an object, it consists of the
 * following keys:
 * <ul>
 * <li> `name`: the name of the action
 * <li> `do`: a further {@link FlowDefintion} for the game to run if this action is
 *   taken. This can contain any number of nested Flow functions.
 * <li> `args`: args to pass to the action, or function returning those args. If
 *   provided this pre-selects arguments to the action that the player does not
 *   select themselves. Also see {@link game#action} and {@link game#followUp}.
 * <li> `prompt`: a string prompt, or function returning a string. If provided this
 *   overrides the prompt defined in the action. This can be useful if the same
 *   action should prompt differently at different points in the game
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param options.name - A unique name for this player action. If provided, this
 * can be used for the UI to determine placement of messages for this action in
 * {@link Game#layoutStep}.
 *
 * @param options.prompt - A prompting message for the player to decide between
 * multiple actions that involve clicking on the board. For example, if a player
 * can choose between playing a card from hand, or drawing from the deck, this
 * text can contain a single prompt that indicates this. This is used only if
 * multiple such selections are available and replaces the individual action
 * prompts. May be a string or a function accepting {@link FlowArguments}.
 *
 * @param options.description - A description of this step from a 3rd person
 * perspective, e.g. "choosing a card". The string will be automatically
 * prefixed with the player name and verb. If specified, will be used to convey
 * to non-acting players what step is happening.
 *
 * @param options.player - Which player can perform this action. If not
 * provided, this defaults to the {@link PlayerCollection#current | current
 * player}
 *
 * @param options.players - Which players can perform this action, if multiple.
 *
 * @param options.optional - If a string is passed, this becomes a prompt
 * players can use to 'pass' this step, performing no action and letting the
 * flow proceed. May be a string or a function accepting {@link FlowArguments}
 *
 * @param options.skipIf - One of 'always', 'never' or 'only-one' (Default
 * 'always').
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> only-one: If there is only valid choice in the choices given, the game
 * will skip this choice, prompting the player for subsequent choices, if any,
 * or completing the action otherwise.
 * <li> always: Rather than present this choice directly, the player will be
 * prompted with choices from the *next choice* in each action here, essentially
 * expanding the choices ahead of time to save the player a step.
 * <li> never: Always present this choice, even if the choice is forced
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param options.repeatUntil - Include this option to make this action
 * repeatable until the player passes. The pass prompt will be the supplied
 * string, similar to `optional`
 *
 * @param options.condtion - Include this option to make this action
 * automatically skip if this condition returns false.
 *
 * @param options.continueIfImpossible - Include this option to make this action
 * automatically skip if none of the actions are possible, either due to the
 * action.condition or due to no valid selections being current available in the
 * game.
